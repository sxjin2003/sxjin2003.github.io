        Currently I'm interested in symplectic topology, especially those topics related to or inspired by nearby
        fields, including mathematical physics, low-dimensional topology, algebraic geometry, and dynamics. Before this
        I was also engaged in complex geometry.

        </a>. I am carrying Research Project for Undergraduate at USTC, supervised by Zhang. The topic is studying Hofer
        geometry via Floer theories.
